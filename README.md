👋 Hi, I'm Tristan.

I’m a research scientist and machine learning engineer with experience in both AI and computational neuroscience.

My core interests and skills include:

- Novel approaches in machine learning
- Neuro-symbolic systems
- AI safety and ethics
- Data analysis and interpretability

I’m equally engaged in theory and practice, developing systems while exploring their foundations.

Currently, I’m part of an international collaboration studying how age-related structural changes in the brain influence neural dynamics, using a novel approach called Connectome Harmonics.

🧠 Inspirations & Interests
I draw inspiration from thinkers like Joscha Bach, Douglas Hofstadter, Selen Atasoy, and Leonid Perlovsky. 

Outside of research, I explore meditation, consciousness, philosophy, and music. I've traveled to 16 countries and counting.
