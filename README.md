I am a research scientist doing work in machine learning and computational neursocience. My machine learning interests include neural representation, neuro-symbolic systems, and data analysis. I am equally invested in machine learning theory and practice.

In computational neuroscience I am participating in an international collaboration doing original research on how changes in the structure of the brain affect during the aging process affects neural dynamics. We are using and developing a novel methodology known as Connectome Harmonics.

Some of my academic inspirations are Joscha Bach, Douglas Hofstadter, Selen Atasoy, and Leonid Perlovsky.

I also like meditatation, consciousnesness research, philosophy, music, and travel. So far I've been to 16 countries.
