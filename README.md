I am a research scientist doing work in AI and computational neursocience. My machine learning interests include neural representation, neuro-symbolic systems, AI safetey and ethics, and data analysis. I am equally invested in machine learning theory and practice.

In computational neuroscience I am participating in an international collaboration doing original research on how changes in the structure of the brain affect during aging affects neural dynamics. We are using a novel methodology known as Connectome Harmonics.

Some of my academic inspirations are Joscha Bach, Douglas Hofstadter, Selen Atasoy, and Leonid Perlovsky.

Other interests include meditation, consciousness research, philosophy, music, and travel. So far I've been to 16 countries.
